# Assignment

`input.txt` contains the manuscript of your next masterpiece.
It is divided up into chapters.
However, you constantly add and remove chapters, causing the numbering to be off.

Each chapter starts with a line containing

```text
Chapter N
```

where `N` is a positive integer.

Your script should renumber all chapters so that the chapters are numbered 1, 2, 3, ...
Write the result to `output.txt`.

## Example

See `example-input.txt` and `example-output.txt`.
