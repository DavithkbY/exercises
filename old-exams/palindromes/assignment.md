# Assignment

You are given a file `input.txt`.
Each line contains one word.
Write a script that collects all palindromes in `input.txt` and writes them to `output.txt`.
The order must be maintained: words listed in `output.txt` must appear in the same order as they do in `input.txt`.

## Example

Say `input.txt` contains

```text
racecar
test
madam
```

The following `output.txt` should then be produced:

```text
racecar
madam
```

## Advice

Experiment with small data sets first: create a small input file yourself containing both
palindromes and non-palindromes and check that your script works.
